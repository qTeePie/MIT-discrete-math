## Problem 1.1

A rearrangement proof - first we arrange the shapes to form a $c \cdot c$ square, prooving that the inner square is $(b - a) \cdot (b - a)$.

Next we arrange the shapes to form two squares, one  $b \cdot b$ and the other $a \cdot a$.

These arrangements proves: 
$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

Since we have only rearranged the shapes, the total area remains the same.
