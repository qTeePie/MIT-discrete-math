## Problem 1.1: Visual Proof of Pythagoras

**(a)** First, we arrange the shapes to form a $c \cdot c$ square, prooving that the inner square is $(b - a) \cdot (b - a)$

**(b)** Next we rearrange the shapes to form two squares, one  $b \cdot b$ and the other $a \cdot a$.

</div>

Since both figures represent the same area —  
**Figure 1**: $c^2$ and **Figure 2**: $a^2 + b^2$ —  
this provides a visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

::: {.callout-note}
Since we simply rearranged the exact same shapes, the total area remains the same in both figures.

**(c)** The construction doesn’t rely on $a = b$. It only assumes the triangles are **congruent** and **right-angled**.

## Bogus Proofs

### Problem 1.2

$$
1 = \sqrt{1}  
= \sqrt{(-1)(-1)}  
= \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}  
= \left( \sqrt{-1} \right)^2  
= -1
$$

**(a)** Illegal use of square roots on negative numbers.

$$
\textcolor{red}{\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}} \quad \textcolor{red}{🚨 illegal!}
$$

**(b)** Prove: if $1 = -1$ → then $2 = 1$

**Add 3 to both sides:**  
$$
1 + 3 = -1 + 3 \Rightarrow 4 = 2
$$

**Divide by 2:**  
$$
\frac{4}{2} = \frac{2}{2} \Rightarrow 2 = 1 \quad \boxed{\textcolor{green}{\checkmark}}
$$

### Problem 1.3

**(a)** $1/8 > 1/4$

**(See PDF for actual proof) **

$\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) > 0 \Rightarrow$ Multiplying by negatives means you got to flip the inequalty sign, which wasn't done in this 'proof'. 

**BOGUS 🚨**

**(b)** Proof below compares $¢$ to $¢^2$. These are two different units.

$$
1¢ = \$0.01 = \textcolor{orange}{(\$0.1)^2 = (10¢)^2} = 100¢ = \$1
$$

The orange term is sus, but probaly legal. Thing is: $$^2$ and $¢^2$ isn't really a unit im familair with... but what the heck, lets go with it. 

**BUT** the red part is where I know the police sirens are blastin'.

$$
... = \textcolor{red}{(10¢)^2 = 100¢} = \$1 
$$

This is where the comparison of our real-life, high-value $¢$ to the suspicious $¢^2$ happens &rarr; **BOGUS**.

**(c)** Division by zero &rarr; **BOGUS**.

$$
\begin{align*}
a &= b \\
a^2 &= ab \\
a^2 - b^2 &= ab - b^2 \\
(a - b)(a + b) &= (a - b)b 
\quad \text{\color{red}(dividing by $(a-b)=0$)} \\
a + b &= b \\
a &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

## My Proofs

### Problem 1.6

> A rational number is any real number that can be expressed as a simple fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ where both numerator and denominator are integers and $b \neq 0$.

$$
\text{A rational number } r \text{ means } r = \frac{a}{b}, \quad a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad b \neq 0
$$

**Claim:** For any integer $n > 0$, $\log_{7} n$ is either an **integer** or an irrational. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\log_{7} n &= \frac{a}{b}, \quad a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad b \neq 0 \quad\text{gcd(a,b)=1}\\
n &= 7^{\frac{a}{b}} \\
n^b &= 7^a \quad ^*
\end{align*}  
$$

>Reminder of the goal: we want to prove that if $\log_{7} n$ is a rational number, it is an integer, meaning that n **HAS** to be a pure power of 7. 

\* The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** says that every number larger than 1 is can be expressed as a product of primes **in exactly one way**. Since RHS $7^a$ can only be expressed as a product of 7(s) and LHS = RHS  &rarr; LHS is a number expressed by the exact same primes as RHS &rarr; $n$ must also be on the form $n = 7^k$ for some integer $k \ge 0$. 

>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in exactly one way, up to the order of the prime factors.

Knowing that $n = 7^k$ for some integer $k \ge 0$, lets use this in the next part of the proof.

$$
(7^k)^b = 7^{kb} = 7^a
$$

LHS and RHS can only be equal if their exponents match.

$$
kb = a
$$

This reads as *When you multiply $k$ and $b$ you get $a$* &rarr; $a$ is a *multiple* of $b$ or other words, $b$ is a *factor* of $a$, the mathematical notation for this is $b \mid a$ which reads $b$ divides $a$.

>* $k$ is an integer because $n = 7^k$ and $n$ is a natural number (by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the exponent in a prime power decomposition is an integer).
* $b$ is an integer by our initial assumption $\log_7 n = a/b$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b>0$.
* Therefore, $k b$ is an integer, and since $k b = a$, this means $b$ is a divisor of $a$.

In the start of our proof we defined $\frac{a}{b}$ being in the lowest terms, AKA their **greatest common divisor is 1** ❗❗

We also defined $b \ge 0$ and proved that $kb = a \Rightarrow b \mid a$, meaning that $b = 1$ because we defined in the start that $b$ and $a$ had **no factors in common with eachother except $1$** &rarr; $b = 1$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\log_{7} n &= \frac{a}{1} \\
\log_{7} n &= a \\
n &= 7^a \\
\end{align*}  
$$

**PROVED** ✅

### Problem 1.9

Prove that if $a \cdot b = n$, then either $a$ or $b$ must be $\le \sqrt{n}$.

We prove this one by using contradiction. Since we are not specifying use of integers, my initial thought of using $\sqrt{n} + 1$ is insufficient... 😅

Rather, we set $a, b \ge \sqrt{n}$.

So we got:

$$
\begin{align*}
a, b &\gt \sqrt{n} \\
ab &\gt \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} \quad \quad \textcolor{orange}{\text{(contradicts $a \cdot b = n$)}}
\end{align*}
$$

**Proof by contradiction**, if both $a$ and $b$ are greater than $\sqrt{n}$, their product will be greater than $n$.

---

### Problem 1.10

**(a)** **Explain** why if $n^2$ is even --- then $n$ is even.

Every integer can be expressed as a product of prime factors. For the number $n$, let's make a set of its prime factors (allowing repeats).
If $n$ is even, $2 \in \{\text{prime factors of } n\}$.

$$
\text{Let } n = \{ 2, p_2, p_3 \} \quad\text{(prime factors of $n$)}
$$

When we square $n$, its prime factors just get duplicated.

$$
n^2 = \{ 2, p_2, p_3, 2, p_2, p_3 \}
$$

So for any $n^2$ that has $2$ as a prime factor, it must have already been a prime factor of $n$. 🔢

**&rarr; They are both even!** 

**(b)** **Same logic as above, but with 3 instead of 2.**

---

### Problem 1.14

The proof assumes $\sqrt{2}$ is rational $\Rightarrow \sqrt{2} - 1$ is rational.

> By the definition of a rational number, we know that subtracting / adding a rational to another rational always results in a rational. 

A number $q$ is then defined as the smallest positive integer such that the following expression produces a **nonnegative integer**.

$$
(\sqrt{2} - 1)q
$$

We know by the nature of square numbers that ${1 \lt\sqrt{2} \lt 2}$, subtract $1 \Rightarrow 0 \lt \sqrt{2} -1 \lt 1$.

Define a new number $q'$.

$$
(\sqrt{2} - 1)q
$$

Multipy the prior inequality by $q$. 

$$
\begin{align*}
0 &\lt \sqrt{2} -1 \lt 1 \\
0 &\lt (\sqrt{2} -1)q \lt q \\
0 &\lt q' \lt q \\
\end{align*}
$$

This is totally fine because we defined $q$ to be a nonnegative integer.

Its time to do the *"simple computation"* the problem description abstracts away. The goal is to prove that $q'$ is an integer smaller than $q$ that, when multiplied $(\sqrt{2} - 1)$ produces a non-negative integer, which would lead to a contradiction. 

$(\sqrt{2} - 1)q' \Rightarrow \textcolor{orange}{\text{Proving this computes to a non-negative integer means } \sqrt{2} \text{ is irrational}}$ 

Start from the definition of $q' \textcolor{blue}{\text{*}}$:

$$
(\sqrt2-1)\textcolor{blue}{q'} \;=\; (\sqrt2-1) \textcolor{blue}{\big[(\sqrt2-1)q\big]} \;=\; (\sqrt2-1)\textcolor{blue}{^2\,q}.
$$

Expand the square:

$$
(\sqrt2-1)^2 \;=\; 2 - 2\sqrt2 + 1 \;=\; 3 - 2\sqrt2.
$$

So

$$
(\sqrt2-1)q' \;=\; (3-2\sqrt2)\,q.
$$


The next step isn't too obvious, the whole deal now is to manipulate the expression so we can swap parts of it with $q'$, so we can discover the properties needed to prove the contradiction.

$(3-2\sqrt{2})q$ contains an expression multiplied by $q$, resembling the definition of $q'$. We'll look at the expression inside the paranthesis, $3-2\sqrt{2}$ to check if it can be rewritten to $(\sqrt{2} -1)$.

Rewrite the coefficient so a $(\sqrt2-1)$ appears (this lets us swap in $q'$ next):

$$
\begin{aligned*}
3-2\sqrt{2} &=
3-2\sqrt2 \;=\; 1 - 2(\sqrt2-1).
\end{aligned*}
$$

Therefore

$$
(\sqrt2-1)q' \;=\; \big[\,1 - 2(\sqrt2-1)\,\big]\,q \;=\; q \;-\; 2(\sqrt2-1)q.
$$

But $(\sqrt2-1)q = q'$ by definition, hence

$$
(\sqrt2-1)q' \;=\; q - 2q'.
$$

* **Integer?** Yes: $q$ and $q'$ are integers, so $q-2q'$ is an integer.
* **Nonnegative?** We need $q-2q'\ge 0$. From $q'=(\sqrt2-1)q$ and
  $(\sqrt2-1)^2>0 \Rightarrow 3-2\sqrt2>0 \Rightarrow \tfrac32>\sqrt2 \Rightarrow \sqrt2-1<\tfrac12$,
  multiply by $q>0$ to get $q'<\tfrac{q}{2}$. Thus $2q'<q$ and so $q-2q'>0$.

So $(\sqrt2-1)q'$ is actually a **positive** integer.

### Contradiction (aka mic drop)

We found a **smaller** positive integer $q'$ with the same property as $q$:
