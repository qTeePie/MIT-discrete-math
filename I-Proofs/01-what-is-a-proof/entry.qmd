# What is a proof? ðŸ”Ž

## Problem 1.1: Visual Proof of Pythagoras

**(a)** First, we arrange the shapes to form a $c \cdot c$ square, prooving that the inner square is $(b - a) \cdot (b - a)$

**(b)** Next we rearrange the shapes to form two squares, one  $b \cdot b$ and the other $a \cdot a$.

Since both figures represent the same area â€”  
**Figure 1**: $c^2$ and **Figure 2**: $a^2 + b^2$ â€”  
this provides a visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

::: {.callout-note}
Since we simply rearranged the exact same shapes, the total area remains the same in both figures.
:::

**(c)** The construction doesnâ€™t rely on $a = b$. It only assumes the triangles are **congruent** and **right-angled**.

## Bogus Proofs

### Problem 1.2

$$
1 = \sqrt{1}  
= \sqrt{(-1)(-1)}  
= \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}  
= \left( \sqrt{-1} \right)^2  
= -1
$$

**(a)** Illegal use of square roots on negative numbers.

$$
\textcolor{red}{\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}} \quad \textcolor{red}{ðŸš¨ illegal!}
$$

**(b)** Prove: if $1 = -1$ â†’ then $2 = 1$

**Add 3 to both sides:**  
$$
1 + 3 = -1 + 3 \Rightarrow 4 = 2
$$

**Divide by 2:**  
$$
\frac{4}{2} = \frac{2}{2} \Rightarrow 2 = 1 \quad \boxed{\textcolor{green}{\checkmark}}
$$

### Problem 1.3

**(a)** $1/8 > 1/4$

**(See PDF for actual proof) **

$\log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) > 0 \Rightarrow$ Multiplying by negatives means you got to flip the inequalty sign, which wasn't done in this 'proof'. 

**BOGUS ðŸš¨**

**(b)** Proof below compares $Â¢$ to $Â¢^2$. These are two different units.

$$
1Â¢ = \$0.01 = \textcolor{orange}{(\$0.1)^2 = (10Â¢)^2} = 100Â¢ = \$1
$$

The orange term is sus, but probaly legal. Thing is: $$^2$ and $Â¢^2$ isn't really a unit im familair with... but what the heck, lets go with it. 

**BUT** the red part is where I know the police sirens are blastin'.

$$
... = \textcolor{red}{(10Â¢)^2 = 100Â¢} = \$1 
$$

This is where the comparison of our real-life, high-value $Â¢$ to the suspicious $Â¢^2$ happens &rarr; **BOGUS**.

**(c)** Division by zero &rarr; **BOGUS**.

$$
\begin{align*}
a &= b \\
a^2 &= ab \\
a^2 - b^2 &= ab - b^2 \\
(a - b)(a + b) &= (a - b)b 
\quad \text{\color{red}(dividing by $(a-b)=0$ â€” ILLEGAL)} \\
a + b &= b \\
a &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
